Graceful Degradation and Service Workers are related in that Service Workers can used to "gracefully degrade" your application. Graceful Degradation is when we start at max technology and address lower levels gracefully. We often do this by adding fallbacks when features fail or aren't supported on a user's browser (while also making sure the fallback looks and runs good). Service Workers aid us in the case that a user's network fails or is super slow, which is a very common situation. In this sense, it helps us gracefully deal with a very low level (having slow/no internet).
